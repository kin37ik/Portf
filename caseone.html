		  <h1>Australia Post</h1>
		  <h4>UX/UI Design / Research / Wireframing / Prototyping</h4>
		  <h4>2023</h4>
		  &nbsp;
		  <div class="backgrnd">
		  <h4>Background</h4>
		  <p>I started this project inspired to create a better solution after experiencing my own problems with Australia Post, i wanted to examine ways to improve the service and make it more friendly to a wider range of people that use the service. Through research, i discovered that the problem in the first place is the website being far too cluttered with far too many options, making it difficult to find what one requires.</p>
		  
		  		  &nbsp;
			  
		  <h4 class="goals">Goals</h4>
		  <p>Redesigning the Australia Post website to be more user friendly and minimizing the myriad of links and options to reduce confusion amongst users.</p>
		  		  &nbsp;
		  <h4 class="problem">Problem</h4>
		  <p>The amount of links and pages for a majority of information is causing customers to become frustrated, lost and finding the information they require. Part of the problem is the overwhelming options and it being time consuming looking for what they need.</p>
		  		  &nbsp;
		  <h4 class="impact">My Impact</h4>
		  <p>For this project i validated the need to re-design the website and leveraged data from the research to create a condensed, comprehensible website service catering to the needs of the user.</p>

		<h1>Research</h1>
		<div class="backgrnd2">
          <h4>Goals</h4>
		<p>Below are the areas i'd like to explore during the user research</p>
		<p>I want to understand:</p>

		<h2>User Interviews</h2>
				  <!--img goes here-->
		<h4>Research Synopsis</h4>
		<p>I was surprised to learn how many users view the website for information regarding legal documents (Tax File Numbers, Police Check ect) and insurance, usually browsing longer than necesarry for what information they need. This led me to discover that what would help the users get onto the right information, would be to condense it down into easily digestible content.</p>
		<h4>Pivot</h4>
		<p>The insights gained from user testing and research gave me confidence that a redesign with simplified information and less links would address the issue at large.</p>

		  <h3>User Persona</h3>
		  <p>After i compiled the results from the research into the affinity map, i was able to create a persona that represents the main user group i am targeting.

		<h1>Ideation</h1>
			<h3>Initial Task Flows</h3>
		  <p>After i compiled the results from the research into the affinity map, i was able to create a persona that represents the main user group i am targeting.</p>
			&nbsp;
		<h3>Website Navigation</h3>
		  <p>Based on information from the card sorting, i designed a simple map re-categorizing and organizing the website</p>
						&nbsp;
		<h3>Lo-fi Wireframes</h3>
		  <p>The first version of lo-fi wireframes allowed me to run usability tests and discover fixes and priorities that need to be implemented as soon as possible. By doing this, it decreased the number of iterations for later revisions towards the hi-fidelity version of the website.</p>
			<p>The version below is just before initial testing with iterations made afterwards</p>

		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		  <p>While working on this project i learned that research and testing is really paramount to working towards the final product that with the best outcome for as many users as possible. Of course its not possible to 100% satisfy everyones wants and needs but even a 10% improvement is much welcome. I learned to not get too hung up on setting the design out in a specific way and to be fleixble in the ways of solving the problem. I beleive that slimming down the myriad of options and condensing the information is fixing the problem at the core.</p>
